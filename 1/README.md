# GRS_PA01 - Process vs. Thread Performance Benchmarking

Roll Number: MT25088

Name: Utsav S Davda (Mtech CSE Sem-2)
## Overview
This project benchmarks and compares the performance of **Processes (Fork)** versus **Threads (Pthread)** under three distinct workloads: CPU-intensive, Memory-intensive, and I/O-intensive. 

The suite automates the execution of these workloads across varying concurrency levels (increasing number of processes/threads), captures system metrics (CPU usage, Memory usage, Disk I/O, and Execution Time), and generates comparative plots for analysis.

## Project Structure
The submission folder `<roll_num>_PA01` contains the following files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `A.cpp` | **Program A:** Implements the 3 worker functions (CPU, MEM, IO) using `fork()` to create multiple processes. |
| `B.cpp` | **Program B:** Implements the same 3 worker functions using `pthread_create()` to create multiple threads. |
| `bench.sh` | **Bash Script:** Automates the execution of Program A and B with varying counts. Captures metrics using `top` and `iostat`. |
| `plot_data.py` | **Python Script:** Reads `results.csv` and generates 4 comparative graphs (PNG format). |
| `Makefile` | **Build System:** Compiles C++ programs, sets permissions, and runs the full benchmark suite. |
| `results.csv` | **Raw Data:** The output file generated by the benchmark script containing recorded metrics. |
| `*.png` | **Plots:** Visualizations generated from the raw data (CPU, Memory, IO, and Time comparison). |

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your Linux environment (or WSL):

1.  **C++ Compiler:** `g++`
2.  **System Monitoring Tools:** `sysstat` (provides `iostat` and `pidstat`)
    * *Install:* `sudo apt install sysstat`
3.  **Python 3 & Libraries:** `matplotlib`, `pandas`
    * *Install:* `pip install matplotlib pandas`

## compilation & Execution

A `Makefile` is provided to automate the entire process.

### 1. Compile Only
To compile `progA` and `progB` executables:
```bash
make
